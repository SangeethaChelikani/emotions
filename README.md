# Emotions

We present here one of the first studies that attempt to differentiate between genuine and acted emotional expressions, using EEG data. We present the EEG dataset with recordings of subjects with genuine and fake emotional expressions.We build our experimental paradigm for classification of smiles; genuine smiles, fake/acted smiles and neutral expression.We propose multiple methods to extract intrinsic features from three EEG emotional expressions; genuine, neutral, and fake/acted smile.
